## Notes

- **Maturity levels:** `raw` → `shaped` → `reviewed` → `ready`
  - `raw`: Phases 0-1 (intake, initial nucleus drafting)
  - `shaped`: Phases 3-4 (expert reviewed via CCR + ASR)
  - `reviewed`: Phases 5-6 (post-CCR loops, implementation-reviewed)
  - `ready`: Phase 9 (execution-ready, GitHub issue created)
- **Maturity transitions** (at checkpoint acceptance):
  - Checkpoint 1: `raw` → `shaped`
  - Checkpoint 2: `shaped` → `reviewed`
  - Checkpoint 3: `reviewed` → `ready`
- **Versioning:** Increment PATCH per saved edit, MINOR on maturity promotion, MAJOR for breaking schema changes
- This nucleus is the pre-CCR iterative artifact; it becomes `2.10-issue-draft.md` when ready for expert review
