# Issue Refinement Runbook — Research Companion

**Purpose:** Provide **research-first** framing and prompts for refining research tickets, without drifting into implementation planning.

**Use with:** `issue-refinement-runbook.md`

---

## Research Ticket Guardrail

If `Ticket type: research`, default clarifying questions to **research framing**:

- Research question(s)
- Prior art + best practices
- Methods + evidence standards
- Synthesis + adjudication approach
- Durable deliverables (PKDP-ready)

Avoid implementation design questions (tooling/code/automation) unless the human explicitly requests implementation planning.

---

## Phase 0/1 — Clarifying Questions (Research Bank)

Use these prompts when refining `Ticket type: research`:

- **Research question:** What question(s) are we trying to answer?
- **Why now:** What decision/capability does this unlock?
- **First principles:** What must hold regardless of implementation?
- **Prior art:** What bodies of work / methods / frameworks should we consult?
- **Thought leaders:** Which authors/projects/groups are authoritative here?
- **Method:** How will we gather and evaluate evidence? What counts as “good evidence” vs weak evidence?
- **Synthesis:** How will we capture disagreement and reach an adjudicated position?
- **Deliverables:** What durable artifact should be produced, and where should it live?
- **Non-goals:** What implementation details are explicitly out of scope for this research ticket?

## Research Definition of Done Addendum (PKDP-Ready)

In addition to the main runbook’s DoD, research tickets should end with outputs usable as PKDP input:

- Clear claims, evidence, caveats, and open questions
- Explicit separation between:
  - observations (what we found)
  - synthesis (what it implies)
  - recommendations (what to do next)

---

## Phase 5 — Draft Issue Loop (Research)

For research tickets, “minor revisions” should primarily refine:

- Research question clarity
- Method / evidence criteria
- Deliverables + durable location
- Scope boundaries (to prevent implementation drift)

---

## Phase 6 — AI Review (Research)

For research tickets, treat Phase 6 as **AI Research Execution Readiness Review**:

- Remaining ambiguities for conducting the research (sources, method, evidence bar)
- Remaining ambiguities for synthesis/adjudication
- Ensuring deliverables are durable and PKDP-ready

Avoid implementation planning questions unless explicitly requested.
